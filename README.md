# CLUB_ENROLLMENT

Problem Statement
The management of student registrations and club enrollments in colleges is often done manually, leading to errors and difficulty in tracking records. To address this, a College Club Enrollment System is required where students can register, enroll in multiple clubs, and administrators can view all enrollments in a single dashboard. This system will simplify record keeping and provide an easy-to-use web interface.



Functionality:
✅ Student registration with validation
✅ Multiple club enrollment
✅ Update existing enrollments
✅ Search and filter enrollments
✅ Real-time statistics
✅ Responsive design
